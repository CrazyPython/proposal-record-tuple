# Record & Tuple Babel Polyfill

This is an experiemental implementation of a `babel` plugin that transpiles Record and Tuples to frozen objects.

This polyfill is a **work in progress** and is not the canonical source of truth for the proposal.

# babel polyfill

1. checkout rickbutton/babel#record-and-tuple
2. bootstrap babel locally
3. link babel packages and install deps:

```bash
npm install
npm run bootstrap
```
